The game also allows players to choose their starting point with their parachutes, and aim to stay in the safe zone for as long as possible. Players can drive vehicles to roam around the map and plan their strategy to survive until the last circle. To win the matches players have to search for weapons, stay in the play zone, loot their enemies and become the last man standing.</p>
