    <p style="font-size: large; margin: 50px;">Carrom is an easy-to-play multiplayer board game where you need to pot all your pieces before your opponent and make sure the queen is secured before ending the game. The game features a traditional theme with smooth controls. Matches can be played in two modes Carrom and Disc Pool. You can play with your friends or go up against online players. Moreover, it also supports offline play so in case you are not in the network zone then it can be a good companion. </p>
